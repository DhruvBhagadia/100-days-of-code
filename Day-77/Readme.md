Day77 (3/5/2019): 

Stack:

1.  Street Parade: https://www.spoj.com/problems/STPAR/ My solution is correct but could also refer to http://code.cloudkaksha.org/spoj/spoj-stpar-solution for an alternative solution
2. Compilers: https://www.codechef.com/problems/COMPILER (Spent a lot of time on this problem. The major thing to note is that they need only the prefix and I wasted alot of time thinking they wanted a sequence from entire String)
3. Bubble sort using two stacks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-using-two-stacks/ (My algorithm is bit different refer: https://photos.app.goo.gl/QjmgB15F2rMY1bkb9)

Queue
1. Dijaktra's: https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHOP/ (The problem is of Queues and not stack and the use of queues is because it is dijaktra's. Initial all weights to INFINITY and then use bfs(which uses queue) and perform relaxation)
