The solution is ehancement to merge sort. Counting inversions helps you with
1. Idea about how distorted the array is (can be used to establish relations)
2. Gives no.of swaps required to sort an array (not necessarily the minimum number which can be found using cycle sort or selection sort)
3. When only adjacent swaps are allowed no.of of inversions=ans.
